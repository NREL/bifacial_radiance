"""A setuptools based setup module.

See:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html
https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject

usage: `pip install -e .`

GenCumulativeSky was conceived, developed and validated by Darren Robinson and Andrew Stone for efficient solar irradiation modelling using RADIANCE
When using GenCumulativeSky they would be pleased if you would acknowledge their work by referring to the following article: "Robinson, D., Stone, A., 
Irradiation modeling made simple â€“ the cumulative sky approach and its applications, Proc. PLEA 2004, Eindhoven 2004."
