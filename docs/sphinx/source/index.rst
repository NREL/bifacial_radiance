Welcome to bifacial_radiance's documentation!
=============================================

bifacial_radiance is a NREL supported tool that provides a set of functions and classes for simulating the performance of bifacial PV systems. More information on bifacial_radiance can be found at the Wiki page.

The source code for bifacial_radiance is hosted on `github
<https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance>`_.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

For examples on how to use bifacial_radiance, please see :ref:`package_overview` and our `Jupyter Notebook tutorials
<http://github.com/Nrel/bifacial_radiance/docs/tutorials/>`_. The documentation assumes general familiarity with Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Google searches will yield many excellent tutorials for these packages.

The bifacial_radiance GitHub wiki has a `Projects and publications that use bifacial_radiance <https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/wiki/>`_ page for inspiration and listing of your application.

There is a :ref:`variable naming convention <variables_style_rules>` to 
ensure consistency throughout the library
