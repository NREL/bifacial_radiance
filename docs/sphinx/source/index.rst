Welcome to bifacial_radiance's documentation!
=============================================

bifacial_radiance is a NREL supported tool that provides a set of functions and classes for simulating the performance of bifacial PV systems. More information on bifacial_radiance can be found at the Wiki page.

The intended audience ranges from PV performance researchers, Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) companies, installers, investors, consumers and analysts of the PV industry interested in predicting and evaluating bifacial photovoltaic systems. 

The source code for bifacial_radiance is hosted on `github
<https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance>`_.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

For examples on how to use bifacial_radiance, please see our `Webinar tutorial video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X9L-R-RVGA>`_. Also find more information on :ref:`package_overview` and our `Jupyter Notebook tutorials
<https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_. The documentation assumes general familiarity with Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Google searches will yield many excellent tutorials for these packages.

The bifacial_radiance GitHub wiki has a `Projects and publications that use bifacial_radiance <https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/wiki/>`_ page for inspiration and listing of your application.

There is a :ref:`variable naming convention <variables_style_rules>` to 
ensure consistency throughout the library
