v0.4.3 (Aug 27 2024)
------------------------
Bugfix Release 


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* A new function can now be called to compile results and report out final irradiance and performance data: ``RadianceObj.compileResults``. (This is a temporary function soon to be deprecated)
* Multiple modules and rows can now be selected in a single analysis scan. ``modWanted`` and ``rowWanted`` inputs in :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.analysis1axis` can now be a list, to select multiple rows and modules for scans. (:issue:`405`)(:pull:`408`)
* To support multiple modules and row scans for 1axis simulations, outputs like Wm2Front are now stored in ``trackerdict.Results``  (:issue:`405`)(:pull:`408`)
* ``mismatch.mismatch.mad_fn`` has new functionality and input parameter ``axis``. If a 2D matrix or dataframe is passed in as data, MAD is calculated along the row (default) or along the columns by passing 'axis=1'
* ``mismatch.mismatch_fit3`` has been deprecated in favour of ``mismatch.mismatch_fit2`` which has a greater agreement with anual energy yield data (:issue:`520`)

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added ``mismatch.mismatch_fit2``, similar to ``mismatch.mismatch_fit3``, with the recommended coefficients of the original publication. (:pull:`520`)
* Including `pyRadiance` as a requirement to help streamline RADIANCE installation and calls in a future release. (:pull:`532`)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed error passing all of ``sceneDict`` into py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene1axis`. (:issue:`502`)
* Fixed  Pandas 2.0 errors by re-factoring py:class:`bifacial_radiance.mismatch.mad_fn`  (:issue:`449`)
* Switch from un-supported Versioneer to setuptools_scm  (:issue:`519`)
* Numpy 2.0 compatibility bug  (:issue:`521`)
* Fixed bug in ``mismatch.mismatch_fit3`` where the function was not returning the correct values. It has also been deprecated in favour of ``mismatch.mismatch_fit2`` which has a greater agreement with anual energy yield data (:issue:`520`)
* Updated Github Actions to use Node20: checkout@v4,  setup-python@v5, coactions/setup-xvfb, setup-buildx-action@v3 (:pull:`517`)
* Updated Github Actions to make Coveralls fail silently if it has an internal server error (:pull:`517`)
* Fix PerformanceWarning and SettingWithCopyWarning (:issue:`515`)
* Switch from Versioneer to setuptools_scm (:pull:`522`)
* Enable ``coerce_year=None`` if the TMYfile is all the same year (:issue:`526`)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Edge effects evaluation tutorial 23, with the new functionality of multiple modules/rows on the same analysis scan.
* Updates to example notebooks 
* Reduce number of digits in makeScene .rad file titles. (:pull:`503`)
* Reduce number of digits saved to files in \results  (:pull:`534`)
* In the sceneDict reported in the trackerdict, save both ``clearance_height`` and ``hub_height`` parameters. (:pull:`503`)
