v0.3.3.2 (04 / 16 / 2020)
--------------------------
Release of new version including fix to sensor orientation, increased py-testing, improved documentation, 


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Glass-front modules now supported.  New Glass material included in `ground.rad` and example for use in ``docs/tutorials/Glass Test.ipynb``
* Source code for `gencumulativesky` is now included along with `makefile` instructions in ``/data/gencumsky/``
* New Torquetube options added on py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeModule`


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.readTMY` now saves the temporal TMY files generated for daydate simulations with different titles to avoid overwriting in parallel simulations.
* Input for daydate added to py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.analysis1axis`, allowing to save cumulative files for daydate. 
* Sorted trackerdict keys on simulations that use trackerdict routines
* Removed deprecation warning and inputs ``nMods`` and ``nRows`` on py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene1axis`
* Modified ``quickExample`` to include testfolder as an input, and returned analysis results. Call to interactive directory selection called from `main.py` instead than being redefined inside the function. (:issue:`201`)
* Removed ``HPCExample`` function from `main.py` (added as a Tutorial Notebook)
* Fix GUI load issue when `None` values passed
* Set GUI default ``modWanted`` and ``rowWanted`` to `Null`
* py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.load.readconfigurationinputfile`.ini input files now use the key ``timeIndexSimulation`` instead of ``timestampRangeSimulation``


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed sensor's orientation error in scanning function calculation, mainly affecting high-tilt angle simulations (:issue:`226`)
* Fix GUI to allow reading null values for ``modWanted`` and ``rowWanted``
* Exception handling for daily simulations in py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.gendaylit1axis`, due to a for loop going out of range for endindex+1 (:issue:`225`)


Testing
~~~~~~~
* Modified pytest assertions for skies to avoid OS issues (ski\etc or skie//etc)
* Added pytesting to py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.getSingleTimestampTrackerAngle`
* Added pytesting to `sceneDict` ``height`` in py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene1axis`
* Added pytesting for py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.AnalysisObj.makeImage` and py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.AnalysisObj.makeFalseColor`
* Added pytest for py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.gendaylit2manual` 
* Added pytest for py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.genCumSky` in py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.modelchain.runModelChain`
* Added pytest for py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.genCumSky1axis` on ``test_1axis_genCumSky()``
* Added pytest for `torque tubes` py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeModule`
* Added pytest for `pitch` and `gcr` on py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene1axis` (:issue:`204`)
* Added pytest to ``quickExample`` (:issue:`201`)
* Added pytest for py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.getEPW`


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Updated bifacial_radiance D.O.E. reference citation on :ref:`_index` (:issue:`213`)
* New Tutorial on AgriPV example included in ''/docs/tutorials/12 AgriPV Systems.ipynb''
* New Tutorial on running HPC Example
* Added Webinar Slides and Tutorial Journal
* Added `pip install` options to :ref:`_installation` 
* Added software compatibility to :ref:`_installation` (:issue:`190`) 
* Added Linux and MacOS instructions to :ref:`_installation` (:issue:`198`) 
* Added content to :ref:`_package_overview` section (:issue:`191`)
* Added `intended audience` to documentation and main Github Readme (:issue:`192`)
* Platform and python-version updates throughout documentation (:issue:`198`)
* Improvements to :ref:`_contributing` guidelines (:issue:`191`)(:issue:`196`)
* Working Folder path fixed on Tutorial Journals for compatibility with other OS Systems (:issue:`217`)
* Updated Youtube's installation instructions to mention how to pip install bifacial_radiance, pip install pvlib, and comments for Linux/Mac OSX users to read the install guide on readthedocs.
* Added suggestion to install Anaconda to run Jupyter Tutorial notebooks in :ref:`_installation` (:issue:`194`)
