v0.3.5 (11 / 06 / 2020)
------------------------
Release of new version including new spectral property class, module analysis when using cells, and other improvements for more seamless use with dask and paralellization.


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
*New `spectral_property` class, with functions to interact with irradiance spectra from SMARTS. `~bifacial_radiance.spectral_property`
*Cell-specific module analysis. When a cell-level module is created, if `sensorsy` matches the number of `cellsy` the sensors will be positioned at the center of each solar cell.
*New ``radname`` input for :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene`, so scenes do not overwrite with parallel processing.
*The software now considers `Year` in variuos of the routines, like metdata reading, sky creation and saving of results. (:issue:`250`)
*The module scans dictionaries ``modscanfront`` and ``modscanback`` are now inputs on in :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.analysis1axis` so the scanning position can be be modified on the tracking routines (:issue:`263`)
*Routine created to add materials to ground.scan `~bifacial_radinace.RadinaceObj.addMaterial` (:issue:`278`)(:issue:`74`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* For data in TMY3 format but has a interval smaller than 1 HR, now the :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.readWeatherFile`, function (which uses pvlib I/O function) fixes the timestamps from the already imported TMY3 data, with the column labeld 'Time (HH:MM)' (:issue:`278`)
* runtimeWarnings are ignored in set1axis. Fixes pvlib tracker #260
* Fixed bug on input file load that would rewrite ''zgap'' parameter as ''ygap''. (:issue:'283')

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* JOSS Journal was published and is now referenced in documentation and READ.ME for citation, along with Zenodo DOIs.
* Journal showing rear irradiance performance with and without white-pavers for ballasting the single axis trackers
* AgriPV Journal improvements, and new Journal studying two crops with PV-module co-location
* Example of running Spectral simulations with the use of dask.
