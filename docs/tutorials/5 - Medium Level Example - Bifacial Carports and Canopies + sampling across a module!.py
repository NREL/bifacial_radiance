# # 5 - Medium Level Example - Modeling Carports and Canopies + Sampling accross a Module!
# 
# This journal shows how to model a carport or canopy ~ a fixed structure, usually at a high clearance from the ground, with more than one bifacial solar module in the same inclined-plane to create a "shade" for the cars/people below.
# 
# We assume that bifacia_radiacne is already installed in yoru computer. This works for bifacial_radiance v.3 release.
# 
# These journal outlines 4 useful uses of bifacial_radiance and some tricks: 
# 
# <ul>
#     <li> Creating the modules in the canopy/carport </li>
#     <li> Adding extra geometry for the pillars/posts supporting the carport/canopy </li>
#     <li> Sampling the rear irradiance with more resolution (more sensors) </li>
#     <li> and hacking the sensor position to obtain an irradiance map of rear-irradiance. </li>
#     <li> Adding an object to simulate a car with a specific reflectivity. </li>
# </ul>
# 
# This is what we will create:
# ![Carport Image We will create](../images_wiki/Carport.png)

# ### 1. Setup of Variables through Making OCT Axis
# 
# We've done this before a couple times, no new stuff here. 
# 
# The magic is that, for doing the carport we see in the figure, we are going to do a 4-up configuration of modules (**numpanels**), and we are going to repeat that 4-UP 7 times (**nMods**)

simulationname = 'HotelCarport'

# MakeModule Parameters
moduletype='PrismSolar'
numpanels = 4  # Carport will have 4 modules along the y direction (N-S since we are facing it to the south) .
x = 0.95  
y = 1.95
xgap = 0.15 # Leaving 15 centimeters between modules on x direction
ygap = 0.10 # Leaving 10 centimeters between modules on y direction
zgap = 0 # no gap to torquetube.
sensorsy = 10*numpanels  # this will give 70 sensors per module.

# Other default values:

# TorqueTube Parameters
axisofrotationTorqueTube=False
torqueTube = False
cellLevelModule = False

# SceneDict Parameters
gcr = 0.33   # We are only doing 1 row so this doesn't matter
albedo = 0.28  #'concrete'     # ground albedo
clearance_height = 4.3 # m  
nMods = 7 # six modules length.
nRows = 1  # only 1 row

azimuth_ang=180 # Facing south
tilt =20 # tilt. 

# Now let's run the example

demo = RadianceObj(simulationname,path = testfolder)  # Create a RadianceObj 'object'
demo.setGround(albedo) # input albedo number or material name like 'concrete'.  To see options, run this without any input.
epwfile = demo.getEPW(40.0583,-74.4057) # NJ lat/lon 40.0583Â° N, 74.4057
metdata = demo.readEPW(epwfile) # read in the EPW weather data from above
demo.gendaylit(metdata,4020)  # Use this to simulate only one hour at a time. 
# This allows you to "view" the scene on RVU (see instructions below)
# timestam 4020 : Noon, June 17th.
#demo.genCumSky(demo.epwfile) # Use this instead of gendaylit to simulate the whole year

# Making module with all the variables
moduleDict=demo.makeModule(name=moduletype,x=x,y=y,numpanels = numpanels, xgap=xgap, ygap=ygap)
# create a scene with all the variables
sceneDict = {'tilt':tilt,'pitch': round(gcr/moduleDict['sceney'],3),'clearance_height':clearance_height,'azimuth':azimuth_ang, 'module_type':moduletype, 'nMods': nMods, 'nRows': nRows}  
scene = demo.makeScene(moduletype=moduletype, sceneDict=sceneDict) #makeScene creates a .rad file with 20 modules per row, 7 rows.
octfile = demo.makeOct(demo.getfilelist())  # makeOct combines all of the ground, sky and object fil|es into a .oct file.


# If you view the Oct file at this point, you should see the array of 7 modules, with 4 modules each along the collector widt.

# ### 2. Adding the pillars
# 
# We will add 4 pillars at roughly the back and front corners of the structure. Some of the code below is to calculate the positions of where the pillars will be at.
# 
# We are calculating the location with some math geometry

# In[2]:


xright= x*4
xleft=  -xright

#centerhubheight = (1.9*3+1.9/2)*np.sin(tilt*np.pi/180)
y2nd = -(y*numpanels/2)*np.cos(tilt*np.pi/180) + (y)*np.cos(tilt*np.pi/180)
y6th=  -(y*numpanels/2)*np.cos(tilt*np.pi/180) + (y*numpanels)*np.cos(tilt*np.pi/180)
z2nd = (y*np.sin(tilt*np.pi/180))+clearance_height
z6th =  (y*numpanels)*np.sin(tilt*np.pi/180)+clearance_height

name='Post1'
text='! genbox black cuteBox 0.5 0.5 {} | xform -t -0.25 -0.25 0 -t {} {} 0'.format(z2nd, xleft, y2nd)
print (text)
customObject = demo.makeCustomObject(name,text)
demo.appendtoScene(radfile=scene.radfiles, customObject=customObject, text="!xform -rz 0")

name='Post2'
text='! genbox black cuteBox 0.5 0.5 {} | xform -t -0.25 -0.25 0 -t {} {} 0'.format(z2nd, xright, y2nd)
customObject = demo.makeCustomObject(name,text)
demo.appendtoScene(scene.radfiles, customObject, '!xform -rz 0')

demo.appendtoScene(scene.radfiles, customObject, '!xform -rz 0')

customObject = demo.makeCustomObject(name,text)
demo.appendtoScene(scene.radfiles, customObject, '!xform -rz 0')

octfile = demo.makeOct(demo.getfilelist())  # makeOct combines all of the ground, sky and object files into a .oct file.


# ### View the geometry with the posts on :
# 
# ## rvu -vf views\front.vp -e .01 -pe 0.4 -vp 3.5 -20 22 HotelCarport.oct
# 
# -pe sets the exposure levels, and -vp sets the view point so the carport is centered (at least on my screen. you can play with the values). It should look like this:
# 
# ![Carpport with posts](../images_wiki/Carport.png)
# 
# The post should be coindient with the corners of the array on the high-end of the carport, and on the low end of the carport they should be between the lowest module and the next one. Cute! 
# 
# 

# <a id='step3'></a>
# 

# ### 3. Analysis of the collector width
# 
# Now let's do some analysis along the slope of the modules. Each result file will contain irradiance for the 4 modules that make up the slope of the carport. You can select which "module" along the row you sample too.
# 
# We are also increasign the number of points sampled accross the collector width, with the  variable **sensorsy** passed to **moduleanalysis**

# In[4]:


analysis = AnalysisObj(octfile, demo.name)  # return an analysis object including the scan dimensions for back irradiance
modWanted = 1
rowWanted = 1
frontscan, backscan = analysis.moduleAnalysis(scene, modWanted=modWanted, rowWanted=rowWanted, sensorsy=sensorsy)

analysis.analysis(octfile, simulationname+"Mod1", frontscan, backscan)  # compare the back vs front irradiance  
print('Annual bifacial ratio average:  %0.3f' %( sum(analysis.Wm2Back) / sum(analysis.Wm2Front) ) )
print("")


# This is the module analysis and an image of the results file
# ![This is the module analysed.](../images_wiki/Carport_analysis.png)
# 
# You can repeat the analysis for any other module in the row:
# 
# <div class="alert alert-warning">
# Notice we are passing a CUSTOM simulation name so the results are generated in separate csv files.
# </div>
# 

# In[5]:


modWanted = 2
rowWanted = 1
frontscan, backscan = analysis.moduleAnalysis(scene, modWanted=modWanted, rowWanted=rowWanted, sensorsy=sensorsy)

analysis.analysis(octfile, simulationname+"Mod2", frontscan, backscan)  # compare the back vs front irradiance  
print('Annual bifacial ratio average:  %0.3f' %( sum(analysis.Wm2Back) / sum(analysis.Wm2Front) ) )


modWanted = 3
rowWanted = 1
frontscan, backscan = analysis.moduleAnalysis(scene, modWanted=modWanted, rowWanted=rowWanted, sensorsy=sensorsy)
        
analysis.analysis(octfile, simulationname+"Mod3", frontscan, backscan)  # compare the back vs front irradiance  
print('Annual bifacial ratio average:  %0.3f' %( sum(analysis.Wm2Back) / sum(analysis.Wm2Front) ) )


# <a id='step4'></a>

# ### 4. Mapping the irradiance througout all the Carport ("Hack" the sensors) 
# 
# You can "hack" the sensors starting locations to obtain an irradinace distribution map. This is easier when the modules are facing South, or East/West. Below is an example, you'll have to repeat over all the modules/ all the surface area with as much resolution as you have patience to see edge-effects.

# In[6]:


# HACK Frontscan and Backscan
frontscan['xstart']=-1.2
        
analysis.analysis(octfile, simulationname+"Mod3_point2", frontscan, backscan)  # compare the back vs front irradiance  
print('Annual bifacial ratio average:  %0.3f' %( sum(analysis.Wm2Back) / sum(analysis.Wm2Front) ) )


# <div class="alert alert-warning">
# The printed Annual bifacial ratio does not include cleaning of the sensors for the material. Some of the sensros might fall in the spacing between the modules (ygaps) or in the structures added, torquetubes, etc. For a real bifacial ratio gain, use the load and clean functions in load.py. 
# 
# (This process might be automated in a future release TBD)
# </div>
# 
# 

# <a id='step5'></a>

# ### 5. Adding a "Car"
# 
# Add a surface (just like we added the pillars) with a specific reflectivity to represent a car. If you are doing hourly simulation you can compare how much the irradiance increases with and without the car, and if you keep track of your parking lot comings/goings this could make an interesting toy-problem: how much are your employees contributing to your rear irradiance production?
