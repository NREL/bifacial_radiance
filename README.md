## Introduction

bifacial_radiance contains a series of Python wrapper functions to make working with 
RADIANCE easier, particularly for the PV researcher interested in bifacial PV 
performance.  For more information, check out our [documentation](https://bifacial-radiance.readthedocs.io), 
[Tutorials in the form of Jupyter Notebooks](docs/tutorials/), or reffer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/wiki)
and [Issues](https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/issues) page.

## Installation

https://youtu.be/4A9GocfHKyM
This video shows how to install the bifacial_radiance software and all associated software needed. More info on the Wiki. Instructions are also shown below.

For detailed instructions of how to install bifacial_radiance, you can also refer to the [installation guide](https://bifacial-radiance.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

## GUI! 

A GUI has been added in version 3.0. The GUI reads/writes all input parameters necessary to run a simulation, and runs the specified simulation by calling the correct functions with the specified parameters. So no need to use a journal or a script! But you still need to install following the procedure below. 

To run the gui, import bifacial_radiance and run bifacial_radiance.gui()

## Usage

We have a tutorial video, showing how the program is structured, how to use the Jupyter tutorials and the GUI. You can watch it here [Tutorial Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X9L-R-RVGA), with the [slides available here](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/75218.pdf)

Check out the [Jupyter Tutorial Notebooks](docs/tutorials/) to see detailed examples of the capacities of bifacial_radiance.
The [Intro examples](https://bifacial-radiance.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introexamples.html) and the [readthedocs documentation](https://bifacial-radiance.readthedocs.io) also provide a good starting point.

## Contributing

We need your help to make bifacial_radiance a great tool! Please see the [Contributing page](https://bifacial-radiance.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html) for more on how you can contribute. The long-term success of pvlib-python requires substantial community support.
